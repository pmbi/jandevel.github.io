# Data Science portfolio by Dmitrii Petukhov

This repository contains a collection of my projects and articles which I have been worked on since September 2017. The projects are written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) for competitions, assignment tasks, self learning and hobby purposes. Click on the projects or articles to see full text, analysis and code.
If you like what you see and you want to have a chat with me about the portfolio, work opportunities, or collaboration, send an email at [dmit.petukhov@gmail.com](mailto:dmit.petukhov@gmail.com), please.
## Contents

- ### Articles

	- [The Gini coefficient. From economics to Machine Learning.](https://habr.com/company/ods/blog/350440/) [(nbviewer)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jandevel/jandevel.github.io/blob/master/gini_coefficient/Gini_coefficient.ipynb)<br>
The purpose of the article is to describe in detail the Gini coefficient metric and to derive formula for this metric by myself. <br>
_Keywords: Mathematics,  Probability Theory, Python_ 
	- [Creating a Virtual Machine in Google Cloud Platform.](https://habr.com/post/341446/)<br>
In this article I showed how to create a VM Instance in Google Cloud Platform.<br>

- ### Projects

	- [Jigsaw - Toxic comment classification.](https://github.com/jandevel/jandevel.github.io/blob/master/jigsaw/project_jigsaw_petukhov_dmitrii.ipynb) [(nbviewer)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jandevel/jandevel.github.io/blob/master/jigsaw/project_jigsaw_petukhov_dmitrii.ipynb)<br>
This is my individual project on ML Course Open where I got first place in the rank. In this project I built a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. I used a dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits. <br>
_Keywords: Python, Data Analysis, Classification, NLP, ROC-AUC_ 

	- [Catch me if you can: intruder detection.](https://github.com/jandevel/jandevel.github.io/blob/master/catch_me/catch_me_petukhov.ipynb) [(nbviewer)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jandevel/jandevel.github.io/blob/master/catch_me/catch_me_petukhov.ipynb)<br>
This is my individual project on "Machine learning and data analysis" specialty by Yandex and MIPT (six courses). In this project I built a model that detect an internet user through webpage session tracking<br>
_Keywords: Python, Data Analysis, Classification, ROC-AUC_ 

	- [How good is your Medium article?](https://github.com/jandevel/jandevel.github.io/blob/master/catch_me/catch_me_petukhov.ipynb) [(nbviewer)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jandevel/jandevel.github.io/blob/master/catch_me/catch_me_petukhov.ipynb)<br>
Kaggle competition where the goal is to predict the number of claps (recommendations) for an article published on Medium (the 9th place out of 386).<br>
_Keywords: Python, Regression, MAE, NLP_ 

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- [Clap it - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/jandevel/clap-it-exploratory-data-analysis)<br>
The purpose of this kaggle kernel is to make exploratory data analysis for the kaggle competition "How good is your Medium article?"
